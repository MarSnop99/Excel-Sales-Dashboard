## 1. Project Objective
The goal of this project was to transform a raw sales dataset into a fully interactive analytical tool. The dashboard enables quick trend identification, regional performance analysis, and the discovery of top-selling products.

## 2. Technologies Used
MS Excel
Power Query: Used for ETL processes (Extract, Transform, Load) – data cleaning, merging, and transformation.
Pivot Tables: Served as the calculation engine for the report.
Pivot Charts and Slicers: Used to create the visual and interactive layer.

## 3. Implementation Process
ETL: Data was imported into Power Query, where it underwent cleaning (error removal, format standardization) and transformation (adding columns for month names and days of the week).
Analysis: The cleaned data was used to create a series of Pivot Tables, aggregating data by key dimensions (time, region, product).
Visualization: Based on the Pivot Tables, an interactive dashboard was built featuring dynamic filters (Slicers) that control all charts simultaneously.

## 4. Key Insights
The highest sales figures are recorded in the Eastern and Western regions.
Sales peak towards the end of the year.
February is the lowest-performing month, and Thursday is the lowest-performing day of the week.

## 5. Usage
Download the .xlsx file, click "Enable Editing", and use the Slicers on the "Dashboard" sheet to dynamically filter the data.
